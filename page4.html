  <p> You'll need </p>
  <ul>
    <li> 1 large jar of mincemeat (about 600g)</li>
    <li> 2 satsumas, segmented</li>
    <li> 1 apple, finely chopped</li>
    <li>zest 1 lemon</li>
    <li> little icing sugar, for dusting</li>
<p> For the pastry: </p>
    <li> 375g plain flour</li>
    <li>260g unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li> 125g caster sugar, plus extra for a cheeky sprinkle</li>
    <li> 1 large egg, plus one beaten egg for a cheeky glaze </li>
<p> Let's get baking!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Place 375g plain flour and 260g softened unsalted butter in a large bowl, and rub together to a crumb consistency</li>
  <li> Add 125g caster sugar and 1 large beaten egg, and mix together</li>
  <li>Tip out onto a lighly floured surface and fold until the pastry comes together, but be careful not to over mix!</li>
  <li>Wrap the pastry into cling film and chill in the fridge for 10 minutes</li>
  <li>Scoop the large jar of mincemeat into a bowl and add two segmented satsumas, one finely chopped apple and the zest of one lemon</li>
  <li>Roll out the pastry to 3mm thick</li>
  <li> Using a round cutter, cut out about 16 bases, placing them into muffin trays. Put 1 and a half tbsp of mincemeat mixture into each. Brush the edge of each pie with a little beaten egg</li>
  <li> Re-roll out the pastry to cut lids and press them on top of the mincemeat filled pies. Glaze with beaten egg, sprinkle with a cheeky bit of caster sugar and make a small cut in the tops or create your own design</li>
  <li>Bake the mince pies for 15-20 minutes until golden brown, and dust with a little more icing sugar before serving!</li>
  <p> To enhance the flavour, serve with a cheeky christmas joke: What did Santa do when he went speed dating? He pulled a cracker!</p>
